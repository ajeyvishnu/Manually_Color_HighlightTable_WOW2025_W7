# WOW2025 | Week 7 | Can You Manually Color a Highlight Table?

![WOW2025 Week 7 Highlight Table Snapshot](Snapshot.png)

## Introduction

This repository contains my solution to the **Workout Wednesday 2025 Week 7 Challenge**. The challenge focused on creating a highlight table where users can manually color specific cells by clicking on them, mimicking Excel-like functionality in Tableau.  

Highlight tables add visual emphasis through color, making it easier to identify patterns and trends. This dashboard takes it further by allowing users to interact with specific cells for custom highlighting.
